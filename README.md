# Full-stack-employee-guide
Want to be a full stack employee? Have fun looking through these resources. And best of all, everything listed here is free (as in free pizza). Feel free to make changes.

Inspired by, amongst all things, this Medium post: https://medium.com/@chrismessina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1

#Coding and Software Development
Web, DB, OS, mobile, it's all here. Stack Overflow is the first thing that comes to mind, I'm not going to describe it, but it is very, very helpful to programmers of all kinds.

##Web Development
W3Schools: Be incredibly careful, as not all of the information on this site is accurate. However, for beginners, this site has been a staple for aspiring web developers for years. Covers everything from HTML to hosting with try-it-yourself tutorials and a hex code color picker. http://www.w3schools.com/

CSS-Tricks: Frontend with a focus on CSS and design. Daily snippets of code you should try out. https://css-tricks.com/

Bento: Courses with different tracks that focus on different strands of the web dev process. Warning, not all of the content is free, although enough of it is to get you going. https://www.bento.io/

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): Alternative to W3Schools, MDN is the official site from Mozilla with information on open web technologies and developer tools. An added bonus is that you can sign up with GitHub if you really, really like it. https://developer.mozilla.org

##Databases

###MySQL
MySQL Docs: If you have time, or get confused, check out the documentation for MySQL. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/

YouTube Playlist: Watch people use MySQL . https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9352E58884CD2B38&feature=mh_lolz

###MongoDB
TutorialsPoint: Similar to W3Schools in terms of layout. Covers simple and more advanced MongoDB topics. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_drop_database.htm
