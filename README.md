# Full-stack-employee-guide
Want to be a full stack employee? Have fun looking through these resources. And best of all, everything listed here is free (as in free pizza). Feel free to make changes.

Inspired by, amongst all things, this Medium post: https://medium.com/@chrismessina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1

#The Plan Layout
One ideally should be a full stack engineer in terms of coding, and should have knowledge of databases. He or she should not be afraid to venture into mobile dev as well. Any other coding skills are a supplement. He or she should be able to create a beautiful, accessible-to-all piece of software that is minimalist yet bold. Have a great product? Well, unless you can sell it to the VC'S/Kickstarter/your mom/etc, your product will sadly die. Brush up on marketing. Like social media? Share your brand there. Is it a web app? Learn SEO. Stuck in the government or at a 9-to-5 F500 boring job? Well, start a starup! No seriously, I'm waiting. Crack out the whiteboards and Expo markers, it's time to write busniess models at 3AM. Want to become a super-disruptor similar to Uber and Airbnb? Read up on boring legal stuff before launch day. While you are it, why don't you start blogging about your journey. 

#Coding and Software Development
Web, DB, OS, mobile, game, it's all here. Stack Overflow is the first thing that comes to mind, I'm not going to describe it, but it is very, very helpful to programmers of all kinds. In general, Google is your friend.

##Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Scripting languages, database languages)
W3Schools: Be incredibly careful, as not all of the information on this site is accurate. However, for beginners, this site has been a staple for aspiring web developers for years. Covers everything from HTML to hosting with try-it-yourself tutorials and a hex code color picker. http://www.w3schools.com/

CSS-Tricks: Frontend with a focus on CSS and design. Daily snippets of code you should try out. https://css-tricks.com/

Bento: Courses with different tracks that focus on different strands of the web dev process. Warning, not all of the content is free, although enough of it is to get you going. https://www.bento.io/

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): Alternative to W3Schools, MDN is the official site from Mozilla with information on open web technologies and developer tools. An added bonus is that you can sign up with GitHub if you really, really like it. https://developer.mozilla.org

##Databases

###(My)SQL
MySQL Docs: If you have time, or get confused, check out the documentation for MySQL. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/

YouTube Playlist: Watch people use MySQL . https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9352E58884CD2B38&feature=mh_lolz

xkcd Comic: ABout a hacker mom who decides to name her son something that causes the school to lose their student records. Every SQL developer should be aware of SQL injection (it's 2015, yet we still have vulnerable databases). https://xkcd.com/327/

###MongoDB
TutorialsPoint: Similar to W3Schools in terms of layout. Covers simple and more advanced MongoDB topics. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_drop_database.htm

###Other Databases

##Operating Systems (C, C++, Java, Assembly, Objective-C, C#)
Both building the OS itself (if it's open source) and applications to run on top of it. 

###Windows
